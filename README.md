- `\uploads <filepath>` or `\uploads`: Upload and analyze multiple images (alias for \images)
- `\file <filepath>` or `\file`: Upload and analyze any supported file type
- `\files <filepath>` or `\files`: Upload and analyze multiple files

Supported models include latest OpenAI options (e.g., `gpt-5`). Use `\menu` to select provider and model interactively.
  
#### Coding Mode Commands
  - `\compact`: Summarize the current conversation to preserve context
  - `\feature <description>`: Add a new feature to the project context file
  - `\clear`: Clear conversation history and current.md file
  
#### Agentic Mode Commands
  - `\agentic` or `\schedule`: Toggle agentic mode on/off
  - Prefix a query with `\a` (or `\agent`, `\agentic`) to run that single query using agentic multi-agent execution
  - `\task <description>`: Create a new task with parallel agents
  - `\smart-conductor`: Toggle using a powerful model as task conductor
  - `\continue`: Grant permission to agents to continue working
  - `\cancel-task`: Cancel the current task

- Input features:
  - Use up/down arrow keys to navigate through input history
  - Use backslash (\\) at the end of a line followed by Enter/Return to continue input on a new line
  - Press Enter on an empty line to submit multi-line input
  - Type `\p` to enter paste mode for multiline pasting (finish with `\\end` on a new line; Windows: `Ctrl+Z` then Enter)
  - Multiline pasting is detected automatically when your terminal supports bracketed paste

### Agent Capabilities

When enabled, the AI can interact with your file system and terminal:

- **File System Operations**:
  - `read`: Read file contents (`\fs read:/path/to/file.txt`)
  - `write`: Write content to a file (`\fs write:/path/to/file.txt:content`)
  - `list`: List directory contents (`\fs list:/path/to/directory`)
  - `exists`: Check if a file exists (`\fs exists:/path/to/file.txt`)

- **Terminal Execution**:
  - Execute shell commands (`\exec ls -la`)
  - Optionally run in a virtual environment using Docker (configurable)

- **Safety Features**:
  - Permission confirmation before file write operations
  - Disallowed command patterns for terminal execution
  - Virtual environment option for sandboxed execution
  - Uses current working directory by default
  - Auto‚Äëapproval (safe): When enabled, non‚Äëdestructive FS ops (`read`, `list`, `exists`) can be auto‚Äëapproved. In Visual mode, safe ops suggested by the AI are executed silently and results are rendered in the Chat pane.

### Keybindings (Vim-like)
QAterm features a Vim-like keybinding system with a prefix key (`Ctrl+S`) for quick access to common commands. The system uses a **hybrid approach** with both toggle modes and execute commands.

#### Hybrid Mode System
**Toggle Modes (Persistent):**
- `Ctrl+S` + `a`: Toggle agentic mode ON/OFF
- `Ctrl+S` + `v`: Toggle visual tri-pane mode ON/OFF  
- `Ctrl+S` + `p`: Toggle paste mode ON/OFF

**Execute Commands (One-time):**
- `Ctrl+S` + `f`: Execute file explorer/selector for any file type
- `Ctrl+S` + `n`: Execute directory navigation
- `Ctrl+S` + `:`: Execute terminal command
- `Ctrl+S` + `h`: Execute help information
- `Ctrl+S` + `m`: Execute settings menu
- `Ctrl+S` + `c`: Execute clear conversation history
- `Ctrl+S` + `t`: Execute TUI file browser
- `Ctrl+S` + `d`: Execute direct model query
- `Ctrl+S` + `r`: Execute project review
- `Ctrl+S` + `s`: Execute system status
- `Ctrl+S` + `w`: Execute file write operation
- `Ctrl+S` + `l`: Execute directory listing
- `Ctrl+S` + `g`: Execute grep search

#### Mode Behaviour
- **Toggle modes** persist until toggled off again
- **Execute commands** run once and return to normal mode
- Current mode is displayed in the interface
- Mode states are tracked independently

#### Configuration
Keybindings can be customized in `keybindings.json`. The system supports:
- Custom prefix key
- Remappable key combinations
- Command aliases
- Mode settings (toggle vs execute)
- Timeout settings

### Automatic Local Scan (Non-destructive)
- What it does: When you ask about a feature in ‚Äúthis app/project‚Äù (e.g., ‚Äúwhat can you tell me about the fzf feature in this app?‚Äù), QAterm will:
  - Detect if you‚Äôre inside a project
  - Inspect docs and entrypoints (README.md, HELP.txt, index.js, package.json main)
  - Run a safe grep across the repo (excluding node_modules/.git) to find references
  - Return snippets grouped by file, without modifying anything
- Toggle: Enabled by default via `autoActions.localSearchBeforeAI` in `config.json`.
- Tip: Use `\review .` for a deeper parallel analysis if grep returns little.

### Visual Mode (Tri‚Äëpane)
Open with `\visual` (alias `\v`).

- Layout: Files (left), Preview (middle; wrapped), Chat (right; wrapped)
- Controls:
  - `Tab`/`Shift+Tab`: Cycle focus (Files ‚Üí Preview ‚Üí Chat)
  - `C`: Ask AI (inline prompt inside Chat pane; Esc cancels). The selected file‚Äôs path and a short preview are included automatically so you can talk about it immediately
  - `V`: Toggle three‚Äëpane layout on/off
  - `S`: Toggle Auto‚Äëscan (toast shown; saved to config)
  - `PgUp`/`PgDn`, `‚Üë`/`‚Üì`: Scroll Chat/Preview when focused
- Notes:
  - Startup banner shows a status row: Auto‚Äëscan, Agentic, Provider
  - Auto‚Äëscan runs only for questions explicitly scoped to ‚Äúthis app/project/repo/codebase/directory‚Äù or when you say ‚Äúreview‚Äù

#### Edit View (single file)
- From Visual mode, select a file and press `E` to open the editor view.
- Layout: Editor (left; Vim‚Äëlike) and AI Chat (right).
- Modes and keys:
  - Normal: `h/j/k/l` move, `i` insert, `o` open line below, `G` end, `:w` save, `:q` quit, `:wq` save+quit
  - Insert: type to edit, Enter to split line, Backspace to merge/delete, `Esc` returns to Normal
  - Paging: `Ctrl‚Äëf`/`Ctrl‚Äëb` page down/up
  - Help: `?` toggles a contextual help bar with the most useful keys for the current mode
- AI collaboration:
  - Press `C` to enter an instruction for the AI (e.g., ‚Äúconvert var to const and fix lint‚Äù).
  - The AI previews changes by sending a full file update; the buffer updates immediately. Save with `:w` to write.
  - Safe FS ops (read/list/exists) from the AI are auto‚Äëapproved; destructive changes still require saving.
